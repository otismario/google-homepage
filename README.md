# google-homepage
This is my first Odins project.
The project is about designing a look alike of Google Home page as can be seen in this archived page.

The project is mainly focusing on html and css and a little bit of Javascript, as the logicl functionalities of the site are not being considered at this stage. 
Some libraries were used, to mention but a few are Font Awesome, Google Fonts, etc.
